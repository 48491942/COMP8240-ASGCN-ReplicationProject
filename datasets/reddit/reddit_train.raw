rockpool bar and grill - it was just really quite average and the worst thing for me is that the worst dishes were $T$ the best was the hiramasa kingfish but frankly, there's about 35,678 restaurants in sydney which have the same dish on their menu executed to the same quality.

$T$ is simply too expensive to take large risks with a menu so you end up seeing the same thing again and again, of course if you venture out to the shadowy lands of the poorly written english menus you can find some great stuff there.
